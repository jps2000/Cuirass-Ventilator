# Cuirass-Ventilator
This is a DIY cuirass ventilator that uses a vacuum cleaner solid state relay and arduino nano to support ventilation without intubation
The respiratory rate can be set with up/ down buttons. A display could be added easily but is not yet included in the code.

A video showing the prototype can be found here: https://youtu.be/EyCMbskHRjY

A cuirass  proposal is designed in Fusion360 on a male torso . Sacle is baout 1:120 . It could be made from epoxy + glass fibre mats used for car repair . The sealing may be made from round foam material That is used as a swimming aid. 

See www.hayekmedical.com  for informations about the working principle. This company issued also a prophetic flyer already in 2014 (see pandemicfinal.pdf)

Little positive pressure for exhalation can be achieved with a sand bag or even a stone (1-2kg) put on the belly.
